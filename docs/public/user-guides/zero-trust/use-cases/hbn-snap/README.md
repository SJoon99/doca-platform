This configuration provides instructions for deploying the NVIDIA DOCA Platform Framework (DPF) on high-performance,
bare-metal infrastructure in Zero Trust mode, utilizing DPU BMC and Redfish. It focuses on provisioning NVIDIA®
BlueField®-3 DPUs using DPF, installing the HBN DPUService on those DPUs and enabling SNAP Storage on those DPUs.

[TOC]

## Prerequisites

This guide should be run by cloning the repo from [github.com/NVIDIA/doca-platform](https://github.com/NVIDIA/doca-platform)
and moving to the `docs/public/user-guides/zero-trust/use-cases/hbn-snap` directory.

The system is set up as described in the [prerequisites](../../prerequisites/README.md).

In addition, for this use case, the Top of Rack switch(ToR) should be configured to support unnumbered BGP towards the two
ports of the DPU, where HBN will act as peer, and advertise routes over BGP to allow for ECMP from the DPU.
The storage traffic between the DPU and the remote storage system goes through a VXLAN interface.
Additional information about the required switch configuration can be found in the 
[Technology Preview for DPF Zero Trust (DPF-ZT) with SNAP DPU Service in virtio-fs mode](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/public/sol/tp+for+dpf+zero+trust+(dpf-zt)+with+snap+dpu+service+in+virtio-fs+mode).

This guide includes examples for both SNAP Block (NVMe) and SNAP VirtioFS Storage.
Depending on the storage type you want to deploy, you need to ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

### SNAP Block (NVMe) Prerequisites

* An remote SPDK target should be set up to provide persistent storage for SNAP Block Storage.
* The SPDK target should be reachable from the DPUs.
* The management interface of the SPDK target should be reachable from the control plane nodes.
* Make sure to check [Host OS Configuration Section in SNAP service documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/snap-4-service-appendixes/index.html#src-4464939880_id-.SNAP4ServiceAppendixesv3.2.0LC-HostOSConfiguration) to validate the host OS configuration on the worker nodes.

### SNAP VirtioFS Prerequisites

* An external NFS server is required to provide persistent storage for SNAP VirtioFS.
* The NFS server must be reachable by both the SNAP DPU service and the nvidia-fs DPU plugin. 
* The NFS service must also be accessible from the DPF control plane nodes to ensure proper operation.
* Make sure to check [Host OS Configuration Section in SNAP VirtioFS service documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/doca-snap-virtio-fs-service-guide/index.html#src-4413882927_safe-id-aWQtLkRPQ0FTTkFQVmlydGlvZnNTZXJ2aWNlR3VpZGV2My4yLjBMQy1BcHBlbmRpeOKAk0hvc3RPU0NvbmZpZ3VyYXRpb25BcHBlbmRpeOKAk0hvc3RPU0NvbmZpZ3VyYXRpb24) to validate the host OS configuration on the worker nodes.

### Software Prerequisites

The following tools must be installed on the machine where the commands contained in this guide run:

* kubectl
* helm
* envsubst

## Installation Guide

This guide assumes that the setup includes only 2 workers with DPUs. If your setup has more than 2 workers, then you
will need to set additional variables to enable the rest of the DPUs.

### 0. Required Variables

The following variables are required by this guide. A sensible default is provided where it makes sense, but many will
be specific to the target infrastructure.

Commands in this guide are run in the same directory that contains this readme.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Environment variables file</summary>

[embedmd]:# (manifests/00-env-vars/envvars.env sh)
```sh

```
</details>

Modify the variables in `manifests/00-env-vars/envvars.env` to fit your environment, then source the file:

```shell
source manifests/00-env-vars/envvars.env
```

### 1. DPF Operator Installation

#### Create storage required by the DPF Operator

A number of [environment variables](#0-required-variables) must be set before running this command.

```shell
kubectl create ns dpf-operator-system
cat manifests/01-dpf-operator-installation/*.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
```

This deploys the following objects:

<details markdown="1"><summary>PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim for the provisioning controller</summary>

[embedmd]:#(manifests/01-dpf-operator-installation/nfs-storage-for-bfb-dpf-ga.yaml)
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: bfb-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  nfs: 
    path: /mnt/dpf_share/bfb
    server: $NFS_SERVER_IP
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete

  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  storageClassName: ""
```
</details>

#### Create DPU BMC shared password secret

In Zero Trust mode, provisioning DPUs requires authentication with Redfish. In order to do that,
you must set the same root password to access the BMC for all DPUs DPF is going to manage.

For more information on how to set the BMC root password refer to [BlueField DPU Administrator Quick Start Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/bf3dpu/bluefield+dpu+administrator+quick+start+guide#src-2449222348_safe-id-Qmx1ZUZpZWxkRFBVQWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvclF1aWNrU3RhcnRHdWlkZS1TdGVwM-KAk0NoYW5nZURlZmF1bHRQYXNzd29yZA)

The password is provided to DPF by creating the following secret:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic -n dpf-operator-system bmc-shared-password --from-literal=password=$BMC_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

#### Additional Dependencies

Before deploying the DPF Operator, ensure that Helm is properly configured according to the
[Helm prerequisites](../../../../getting-started/helm-prerequisites.md).

> [!WARNING]
> This is a critical prerequisite step that must be completed for the DPF Operator to function properly.

#### Deploy the DPF Operator

A number of [environment variables](#0-required-variables) must be set before running this command.

##### HTTP Registry (default)

If the $REGISTRY is an HTTP Registry (default value) use this command:
```shell
helm repo add --force-update dpf-repository ${REGISTRY}
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install -n dpf-operator-system dpf-operator dpf-repository/dpf-operator --version=$TAG
```

##### OCI Registry

For development purposes, if the $REGISTRY is an OCI Registry use this command:
```shell
helm upgrade --install -n dpf-operator-system dpf-operator $REGISTRY/dpf-operator --version=$TAG
```

#### Verification

These verification commands may need to be run multiple times to ensure the condition is met.

Verify the DPF Operator installation with:
```shell
## Ensure the DPF Operator deployment is available.
kubectl rollout status deployment --namespace dpf-operator-system dpf-operator-controller-manager
## Ensure all pods in the DPF Operator system are ready.
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready --namespace dpf-operator-system pods --all
```


### 2. DPF System Installation

This section involves creating the DPF system components and some basic infrastructure required for a functioning
DPF-enabled cluster.

#### Deploy the DPF System components

A number of [environment variables](#0-required-variables) must be set before running this command.

```shell
kubectl create ns dpu-cplane-tenant1
cat manifests/02-dpf-system-installation/*.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will create the following objects:
<details markdown="1"><summary>DPFOperatorConfig to install the DPF System components</summary>

```
</details>


#### Verification

These verification commands may need to be run multiple times to ensure the condition is met.

Verify the DPF System with:
```shell
## Ensure the provisioning and DPUService controller manager deployments are available.
kubectl rollout status deployment --namespace dpf-operator-system dpf-provisioning-controller-manager dpuservice-controller-manager
## Ensure all other deployments in the DPF Operator system are Available.
kubectl rollout status deployment --namespace dpf-operator-system
## Ensure bfb registry daemonset is available
kubectl rollout status daemonset --namespace dpf-operator-system bfb-registry
## Ensure the DPUCluster is ready for nodes to join.
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready --namespace dpu-cplane-tenant1 dpucluster --all
```

### 3. DPU Provisioning and Service Installation

In this section, you'll provision your DPUs and deploy the required services. You'll need to create a `DPUDeployment` object that defines which `DPUServices` should be installed on each selected DPU. This provides a flexible way to specify and manage the services that run on your DPUs.

> If you want to learn more about `DPUDeployments`, check the [DPUDeployment documentation](../../../../developer-guides/api/dpudeployment.md).

This guide includes examples for both SNAP Block (NVMe) and SNAP VirtioFS Storage.
Please refer to the relevant sections below and follow the instructions to deploy the desired storage type.

> [!NOTE]
> Storage use-cases set `RDMA_SET_NETNS_EXCLUSIVE="no"` in the DPUFlavor, putting the DPU in shared RDMA
> mode. The default SFC NAD (`mybrsfc`) enables RDMA for SF interfaces, which is not compatible with
> shared RDMA mode. All services deployed on a DPU provisioned with a storage flavor that use SF
> interfaces must reference a NAD without RDMA. A custom DPUServiceNAD (`mybrsfc-storage`) is included
> in the manifests below for this reason.

#### SNAP Block (NVMe)

A number of [environment variables](#0-required-variables) must be set before running these commands.

##### Create Vendor CSI Controller Credentials

Create the credential request for the SPDK CSI Controller before installing the chart:

```shell
kubectl apply -f manifests/03.1-dpudeployment-installation-nvme/credentials/
```

<details markdown="1"><summary>DPUServiceCredentialRequest for SPDK CSI Controller</summary>

[embedmd]:#(manifests/03.1-dpudeployment-installation-nvme/credentials/spdk-csi-controller-dpuservicecredentialrequest.yaml)
```yaml
---

##### Verification

These verification commands may need to be run multiple times to ensure the condition is met.

Note that the DPUService name will have a random suffix. For example, `doca-hbn-l2xsl`.

Verify the DPU and Service installation with:

```shell
## Ensure the DPUServices are created and have been reconciled.
kubectl wait --for=condition=ApplicationsReconciled --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuservices -l svc.dpu.nvidia.com/owned-by-dpudeployment=dpf-operator-system_hbn-snap
## Ensure the DPUServiceIPAMs have been reconciled
kubectl wait --for=condition=DPUIPAMObjectReconciled --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuserviceipam --all
## Ensure the DPUServiceInterfaces have been reconciled
kubectl wait --for=condition=ServiceInterfaceSetReconciled --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuserviceinterface --all
## Ensure the DPUServiceChains have been reconciled
kubectl wait --for=condition=ServiceChainSetReconciled --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuservicechain --all
## Ensure the DPUs have the condition Initialized (this may take time)
kubectl wait --for=condition=Initialized --namespace dpf-operator-system dpu --all
```

or with `dpfctl`:

```shell
$ kubectl -n dpf-operator-system exec deploy/dpf-operator-controller-manager -- /dpfctl describe dpudeployments
```

##### Apply Storage Configuration

A number of [environment variables](#0-required-variables) must be set before running this command.

```shell
cat manifests/04.1-storage-configuration-nvme/*.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will create the following objects:

<details markdown="1"><summary>DPUStorageVendor for SPDK CSI</summary>

[embedmd]:#(manifests/04.1-storage-configuration-nvme/spdk-csi-dpustoragevendor.yaml)
```yaml
---
apiVersion: storage.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DPUStorageVendor
metadata:
  name: spdk-csi
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  storageClassName: spdkcsi-sc
  pluginName: nvidia-block
```
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>DPUStoragePolicy for block storage</summary>

[embedmd]:#(manifests/04.1-storage-configuration-nvme/policy-block-dpustoragepolicy.yaml)
```yaml

metadata:
  name: policy-block
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  dpuStorageVendors:
    - spdk-csi
  selectionAlgorithm: "NumberVolumes"
  parameters: {}
```
</details>

Check that the objects are ready:

```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --namespace dpf-operator-system dpustoragevendors --all
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --namespace dpf-operator-system dpustoragepolicies --all
```

##### Create static volume attachments

A number of [environment variables](#0-required-variables) must be set before running this command.

```shell
cat manifests/05.1-storage-test-nvme/*.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will create the following objects:

<details markdown="1"><summary>DPUVolumes for block storage</summary>

[embedmd]:#(manifests/05.1-storage-test-nvme/dpuvolume.yaml)
```yaml
---
apiVersion: storage.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>DPUVolumeAttachments for block storage with static PFs</summary>

[embedmd]:#(manifests/05.1-storage-test-nvme/dpuvolumeattachment.yaml)
```yaml
---
apiVersion: storage.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DPUVolumeAttachment
metadata:
  name: test-volume-attachment-static-pf-${DPU1_SERIAL}
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  dpuNodeName: dpu-node-${DPU1_SERIAL}
  dpuVolumeName: test-volume-static-pf-${DPU1_SERIAL}
  functionType: pf
  hotplugFunction: false
---
apiVersion: storage.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DPUVolumeAttachment
metadata:
  name: test-volume-attachment-static-pf-${DPU2_SERIAL}
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  dpuNodeName: dpu-node-${DPU2_SERIAL}
  dpuVolumeName: test-volume-static-pf-${DPU2_SERIAL}
  functionType: pf
  hotplugFunction: false
```
</details>

At this stage, volumes can be created, but they will not be attached to the DPUs yet, because the DPUs are not ready.

Verify that the DPUVolume resources are in the Ready state:

```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuvolumes --all
```

> [!WARNING]
> Be sure to create DPUVolumeAttachments that are using static PFs *before* rebooting the hosts.
> If you reboot the hosts without creating these attachments, the hardware initialization process on the host can be significantly delayed, due to timeouts caused by partially initialized emulated NVMe controllers.
> Creating the attachments ahead of time ensures that SNAP services can complete initialization of the emulated NVMe controllers right after the DPUs become ready.

##### Releasing the Node Effect Hold

Since the DPUDeployment is configured with `nodeEffect.hold: true`, the DPUs will pause at the "Node Effect"
phase and wait for external action before proceeding with provisioning. This gives the administrator control
over when the node effect is applied.

To check that DPUNodeMaintenance objects have been created and are in the hold state:

```shell
kubectl get dpunodemaintenances -n dpf-operator-system
```

Once you are ready for provisioning to proceed, release the hold by setting the annotation on the
DPUNodeMaintenance objects to `"false"`. You can do this per-node or all at once:

```shell
kubectl annotate --overwrite dpunodemaintenances -n dpf-operator-system --all provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/wait-for-external-nodeeffect=false
```

After releasing the hold, the DPUs will proceed through the remaining provisioning phases (BFB installation,
OS installation, etc.).

##### Making the DPUs Ready

In order to make the DPUs ready, we will need to manually power cycle the hosts. This operation should be done in the
most graceful manner by gracefully shutting down the Host and DPU, powering off the server and then powering it on to
avoid corruption. This should happen when the object gives us the signal. The described flow can be automated by the
admin depending on the infrastructure. The following verification command may need to be run multiple times to ensure the condition is met.

```shell
## Ensure the DPUs are in the Rebooting phase and condition Rebooted is false with WaitingForManualPowerCycleOrReboot reason
kubectl wait --for=jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Rebooted")].reason}'=WaitingForManualPowerCycleOrReboot --namespace dpf-operator-system dpu --all 
```

or with `dpfctl`:

```shell
$ kubectl -n dpf-operator-system exec deploy/dpf-operator-controller-manager -- /dpfctl describe dpudeployments
```

At this point, we have to power cycle the hosts.

>[!NOTE]
> For the SNAP Block (NVMe) scenario, you do not need to wait for the host to fully boot after a power cycle before removing the annotation below.
> On some server platforms, device initialization may be waiting for a long time until the SNAP service on the DPU becomes ready,
> so it is recommended to remove the annotation immediately after initiating the host power cycle.


```shell
kubectl annotate dpunodes -n dpf-operator-system --all provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/dpunode-external-reboot-required-
```

After this is done, we should expect that all DPUs become Ready:

```shell
kubectl wait --for="jsonpath={.status.phase}=Ready" --namespace dpf-operator-system dpu --all
```

or with dpfctl:

```shell
$ kubectl -n dpf-operator-system exec deploy/dpf-operator-controller-manager -- /dpfctl describe dpudeployments
```


DPUVolumeAttachments that were created in the previous step should become Ready after some time:
```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuvolumeattachments --all
```

##### Test Block Storage

###### Test Block Storage with Static PFs

A number of [environment variables](#0-required-variables) must be set before running this command.

First we check DPUVolumes that were exposed through the static storage PFs.

On the host that is used to run this guide, get the PCI address of the DPUVolumeAttachment:

```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready dpuvolumeattachments/test-volume-attachment-static-pf-${DPU1_SERIAL} -n dpf-operator-system
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready dpuvolumeattachments/test-volume-attachment-static-pf-${DPU2_SERIAL} -n dpf-operator-system
pci_address_1=$(printf "0000:%s" "$(kubectl get -n dpf-operator-system dpuvolumeattachments.storage.dpu.nvidia.com test-volume-attachment-static-pf-${DPU1_SERIAL} -o jsonpath='{.status.dpu.pciAddress}')")
pci_address_2=$(printf "0000:%s" "$(kubectl get -n dpf-operator-system dpuvolumeattachments.storage.dpu.nvidia.com test-volume-attachment-static-pf-${DPU2_SERIAL} -o jsonpath='{.status.dpu.pciAddress}')")
echo "Worker $DPU1_SERIAL NMMe PCI address: $pci_address_1"
echo "Worker $DPU2_SERIAL NMMe PCI address: $pci_address_2"
```

Connect to the worker nodes with DPUs and set pci address variable to point to the PCI address retrieved in the previous step.

```shell
pci_address=<set to the PCI address that you retrieved in the previous step>
```

Check the current driver for the device

```shell
ls -lah /sys/bus/pci/devices/"$pci_address"/driver
```

If the device has no driver, you may need to manually bind it.

```shell
echo nvme > /sys/bus/pci/devices/$pci_address/driver_override
echo $pci_address > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvme/bind
```

Find the block device name

```shell
block_dev_name=$(basename /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvme/"$pci_address"/nvme/*/nvme*)
echo "Block device name: $block_dev_name"
```

Format the device to the filesystem or use it as a raw block device.

Example how to format the device with ext4 filesystem and perform I/O operations:

```shell
mkfs.ext4 /dev/"$block_dev_name"
mkdir -p /tmp/test-volume-static-pf
mount /dev/"$block_dev_name" /tmp/test-volume-static-pf

dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/test-volume-static-pf/test.txt bs=1M count=1000 status=progress
```

```shell
umount /tmp/test-volume-static-pf
```

###### Test Block Storage with Hot-plug PFs

A number of [environment variables](#0-required-variables) must be set before running this command.

Create DPUVolume and DPUVolumeAttachment for hot-plug storage PFs :

```shell
cat manifests/05.1-storage-test-nvme/hotplug/*.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will create the following objects:

<details markdown="1"><summary>DPUVolume for hot-plug storage PFs</summary>

[embedmd]:#(manifests/05.1-storage-test-nvme/hotplug/dpuvolume.yaml)

  dpuVolumeName: test-volume-hotplug-pf-${DPU2_SERIAL}
  functionType: pf
  hotplugFunction: true
```
</details>


On the host that is used to run this guide, get the PCI address of the DPUVolumeAttachment:

```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready dpuvolumeattachments/test-volume-attachment-hotplug-pf-${DPU1_SERIAL} -n dpf-operator-system
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready dpuvolumeattachments/test-volume-attachment-hotplug-pf-${DPU2_SERIAL} -n dpf-operator-system
pci_address_1=$(printf "0000:%s" "$(kubectl get -n dpf-operator-system dpuvolumeattachments.storage.dpu.nvidia.com test-volume-attachment-hotplug-pf-${DPU1_SERIAL} -o jsonpath='{.status.dpu.pciAddress}')")
pci_address_2=$(printf "0000:%s" "$(kubectl get -n dpf-operator-system dpuvolumeattachments.storage.dpu.nvidia.com test-volume-attachment-hotplug-pf-${DPU2_SERIAL} -o jsonpath='{.status.dpu.pciAddress}')")
echo "Worker $DPU1_SERIAL NMMe PCI address: $pci_address_1"
echo "Worker $DPU2_SERIAL NMMe PCI address: $pci_address_2"
```

After volumes are successfully attached repeat the steps from the [Test Block Storage with Static PFs](#test-block-storage-with-static-pfs) section.


#### SNAP VirtioFS

##### Verification

These verification commands may need to be run multiple times to ensure the condition is met.

Note that the DPUService name will have a random suffix. For example, `doca-hbn-l2xsl`.

Verify the DPU and Service installation with:

```shell
## Ensure the DPUServices are created and have been reconciled.
kubectl wait --for=condition=ApplicationsReconciled --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuservices -l svc.dpu.nvidia.com/owned-by-dpudeployment=dpf-operator-system_hbn-snap
## Ensure the DPUServiceIPAMs have been reconciled
kubectl wait --for=condition=DPUIPAMObjectReconciled --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuserviceipam --all
## Ensure the DPUServiceInterfaces have been reconciled
kubectl wait --for=condition=ServiceInterfaceSetReconciled --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuserviceinterface --all
## Ensure the DPUServiceChains have been reconciled
kubectl wait --for=condition=ServiceChainSetReconciled --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuservicechain --all
## Ensure the DPUs have the condition Initialized (this may take time)
kubectl wait --for=condition=Initialized --namespace dpf-operator-system dpu --all
```

or with `dpfctl`:

```shell
$ kubectl -n dpf-operator-system exec deploy/dpf-operator-controller-manager -- /dpfctl describe dpudeployments
```

##### Apply Storage Configuration

A number of [environment variables](#0-required-variables) must be set before running this command.

```shell
cat manifests/04.2-storage-configuration-virtiofs/*.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will create the following objects:

<details markdown="1"><summary>DPUStorageVendor for NFS CSI</summary>

[embedmd]:#(manifests/04.2-storage-configuration-virtiofs/nfs-csi-dpustoragevendor.yaml)
```yaml
---
apiVersion: storage.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DPUStorageVendor
metadata:
  name: nfs-csi
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  storageClassName: nfs-csi
  pluginName: nvidia-fs
```
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>DPUStoragePolicy for filesystem storage</summary>

[embedmd]:#(manifests/04.2-storage-configuration-virtiofs/policy-fs-dpustoragepolicy.yaml)
```yaml
---
apiVersion: storage.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DPUStoragePolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-fs
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  dpuStorageVendors:
    - nfs-csi
  selectionAlgorithm: "NumberVolumes"
  parameters: {}
```
</details>

Check that the objects are ready:

```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --namespace dpf-operator-system dpustoragevendors --all
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --namespace dpf-operator-system dpustoragepolicies --all
```

##### Releasing the Node Effect Hold

Since the DPUDeployment is configured with `nodeEffect.hold: true`, the DPUs will pause at the "Node Effect"
phase and wait for external action before proceeding with provisioning. This gives the administrator control
over when the node effect is applied.

To check that DPUNodeMaintenance objects have been created and are in the hold state:

```shell
kubectl get dpunodemaintenances -n dpf-operator-system
```

Once you are ready for provisioning to proceed, release the hold by setting the annotation on the
DPUNodeMaintenance objects to `"false"`. You can do this per-node or all at once:

```shell
kubectl annotate --overwrite dpunodemaintenances -n dpf-operator-system --all provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/wait-for-external-nodeeffect=false
```

After releasing the hold, the DPUs will proceed through the remaining provisioning phases (BFB installation,
OS installation, etc.).

##### Making the DPUs Ready

In order to make the DPUs ready, we will need to manually power cycle the hosts. This operation should be done in the
most graceful manner by gracefully shutting down the Host and DPU, powering off the server and then powering it on to
avoid corruption. This should happen when the object gives us the signal. The described flow can be automated by the
admin depending on the infrastructure. The following verification command may need to be run multiple times to ensure the condition is met.

```shell
## Ensure the DPUs are in the Rebooting phase and condition Rebooted is false with WaitingForManualPowerCycleOrReboot reason
kubectl wait --for=jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Rebooted")].reason}'=WaitingForManualPowerCycleOrReboot --namespace dpf-operator-system dpu --all
```

or with `dpfctl`:

```shell
$ kubectl -n dpf-operator-system exec deploy/dpf-operator-controller-manager -- /dpfctl describe dpudeployments
```

At this point, we have to power cycle the hosts.

```shell
kubectl annotate dpunodes -n dpf-operator-system --all provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/dpunode-external-reboot-required-
```

After this is done, we should expect that all DPUs become Ready:

```shell
kubectl wait --for="jsonpath={.status.phase}=Ready" --namespace dpf-operator-system dpu --all
```

or with dpfctl:

```shell
$ kubectl -n dpf-operator-system exec deploy/dpf-operator-controller-manager -- /dpfctl describe dpudeployments
```

##### Test VirtioFS Storage

A number of [environment variables](#0-required-variables) must be set before running this command.

Create DPUVolume and DPUVolumeAttachment for VirtioFS storage:

```shell
cat manifests/05.2-storage-test-virtiofs/*.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will create the following objects:

<details markdown="1"><summary>DPUVolume for VirtioFS storage</summary>

[embedmd]:#(manifests/05.2-storage-test-virtiofs/dpuvolume.yaml)
```yaml
---
apiVersion: storage.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1

  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  dpuStoragePolicyName: policy-fs

    requests:
      storage: 10Gi

      storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:

```
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>DPUVolumeAttachment for VirtioFS storage</summary>

[embedmd]:#(manifests/05.2-storage-test-virtiofs/dpuvolumeattachment.yaml)
```yaml
---
apiVersion: storage.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DPUVolumeAttachment
metadata:
  name: test-volume-attachment-virtiofs-hotplug-pf-${DPU1_SERIAL}
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  dpuNodeName: dpu-node-${DPU1_SERIAL}
  dpuVolumeName: test-volume-virtiofs-hotplug-pf-${DPU1_SERIAL}
  functionType: pf
  hotplugFunction: true
---
apiVersion: storage.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DPUVolumeAttachment
metadata:
  name: test-volume-attachment-virtiofs-hotplug-pf-${DPU2_SERIAL}
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  dpuNodeName: dpu-node-${DPU2_SERIAL}
  dpuVolumeName: test-volume-virtiofs-hotplug-pf-${DPU2_SERIAL}
  functionType: pf
  hotplugFunction: true
```
</details>

Verify that the DPUVolume resources are in the Ready state:

```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuvolumes --all
```

Wait for the DPUVolumeAttachments to become Ready:

```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --namespace dpf-operator-system dpuvolumeattachments --all
```

On the host that is used to run this guide, get the VirtioFS tag name of the DPUVolumeAttachment:

```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready dpuvolumeattachments/test-volume-attachment-virtiofs-hotplug-pf-${DPU1_SERIAL} -n dpf-operator-system
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready dpuvolumeattachments/test-volume-attachment-virtiofs-hotplug-pf-${DPU2_SERIAL} -n dpf-operator-system
tag_1=$(kubectl get -n dpf-operator-system dpuvolumeattachments.storage.dpu.nvidia.com test-volume-attachment-virtiofs-hotplug-pf-${DPU1_SERIAL} -o jsonpath='{.status.dpu.virtioFSAttrs.filesystemTag}')
tag_2=$(kubectl get -n dpf-operator-system dpuvolumeattachments.storage.dpu.nvidia.com test-volume-attachment-virtiofs-hotplug-pf-${DPU2_SERIAL} -o jsonpath='{.status.dpu.virtioFSAttrs.filesystemTag}')
echo "Worker $DPU1_SERIAL VirtioFS tag: $tag_1"
echo "Worker $DPU2_SERIAL VirtioFS tag: $tag_2"
```

Connect to the worker nodes with DPUs and set tag variable to point to the VirtioFS tag retrieved in the previous step.

```shell
tag=<set to the VirtioFS tag that you retrieved in the previous step>
```

Make sure the VirtioFS driver is loaded:

```shell
modprobe virtiofs
```

Create a directory to mount the volume:

```shell
mkdir -p /tmp/test-volume-virtiofs-hotplug-pf
```

Mount the volume:

```shell
mount -t virtiofs $tag /tmp/test-volume-virtiofs-hotplug-pf
```

Perform I/O operations to test the storage:

```shell
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/test-volume-virtiofs-hotplug-pf/test.txt bs=1M count=1000 status=progress
```

Unmount the volume:

```shell
umount /tmp/test-volume-virtiofs-hotplug-pf
```

#### Test Network Traffic

Both Block and VirtioFS scenarios can be tested with the same steps.

After the DPUs are provisioned and the rest of the objects are Ready, we can test traffic by assigning an IP to the PF0
on the host for each DPU, and run a simple ping. Although the configuration is enabling both PFs, we focus on the PF0 for
testing traffic. Assuming the PF0 is named `ens5f0np0`:

On the host with DPU with serial number DPU1_SERIAL:

```shell
ip link set dev ens5f0np0 up
ip addr add 10.0.121.1/29 dev ens5f0np0
ip route add 10.0.121.0/24 dev ens5f0np0 via 10.0.121.2
```

On the host with DPU with serial number DPU2_SERIAL:

```shell
ip link set dev ens5f0np0 up
ip addr add 10.0.121.9/29 dev ens5f0np0
ip route add 10.0.121.0/24 dev ens5f0np0 via 10.0.121.10
```

On the host with DPU with serial number DPU1_SERIAL:

```shell
$ ping 10.0.121.9 -c3
PING 10.0.121.9 (10.0.121.9) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.0.121.9: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.387 ms

```

## Uninstall

This section covers only the DPF related components and not the prerequisites as these must be managed by the admin.

### Delete storage resources

>[!WARNING]
> Be sure to unmount all volumes from the worker nodes before deleting the DPUVolumeAttachments or the operation may fail.
> For NVMe attachments, it is recommended to unbind the device from the driver before deleting the DPUVolumeAttachment. `echo <pci_address> > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvme/unbind`

```shell
kubectl delete -n dpf-operator-system dpuvolumeattachments --all --wait
kubectl delete -n dpf-operator-system dpuvolumes --all --wait
kubectl delete -n dpf-operator-system dpustoragepolicies --all --wait
kubectl delete -n dpf-operator-system dpustoragevendors --all --wait
```

### Delete Storage Controllers from the Host Cluster

```shell
helm uninstall -n dpf-operator-system snap-host-controller --wait
# SNAP Block (NVMe) only:
helm uninstall -n dpf-operator-system spdk-csi-controller --wait
# SNAP VirtioFS only:
helm uninstall -n dpf-operator-system nfs-csi-controller --wait
```

### Delete the DPF Operator system and DPF Operator

```shell
kubectl delete -n dpf-operator-system dpfoperatorconfig dpfoperatorconfig --wait
helm uninstall -n dpf-operator-system dpf-operator --wait
```

### Delete DPF Operator PVC

```shell
kubectl -n dpf-operator-system delete pvc bfb-pvc
kubectl delete pv bfb-pv
```

Note: there can be a race condition with deleting the underlying Kamaji cluster which runs the DPU cluster control
plane in this guide. If that happens it may be necessary to remove finalizers manually from `DPUCluster` and `Datastore`
objects.
