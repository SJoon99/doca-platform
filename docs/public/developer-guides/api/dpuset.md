[TOC]

The DPUSet is a Kubernetes CRD which managed the DPU CRs in DPF.

## Updating the DPUSet

An update to the DPUSet can be done for upgrading the BFB or modifying provisioning parameters.

> [!NOTE]
> This operation will result in a network
> disruption and also a host reboot.
> A rolling update can be configured to control the number of nodes that will be out-of-service in parallel (Please see
> the DPUSet YAML example below).
> The cluster can also be divided into several DPU-Sets, please refer to the section
> "Using several DPU Sets"

These are the required steps for upgrading the BFB on a set of DPUs
(The BFB is specified as part of the DPU Set CRD):

**1.** Create a BFB YAML that includes the required BFB file and also assigns a distinct name for the object (Different
from the currently used BFB objects). After applying the YAML, the BFB will be pulled from the specified URL to the
shared storage:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: BFB
metadata:
  name: bf-bundle-new
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  url: https://content.mellanox.com/BlueField/BFBs/Ubuntu24.04/bf-bundle-3.2.1-34_25.11_ubuntu-24.04_64k_prod.bfb
```

**2.** Update the DPUSet YAML to point to the new BFB object:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DPUSet
metadata:
  name: dpuset
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  dpuNodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      feature.node.kubernetes.io/dpu-enabled: "true"
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: "10%"
    type: RollingUpdate
  dpuTemplate:
    spec:
      dpuFlavor: passthrough
      bfb:
        name: bf-bundle-new
      nodeEffect:
        taint:
          key: "dpu"
          value: "provisioning"
          effect: NoSchedule
```

**3.** Then delete the DPU objects of the relevant DPUs.

This will initiate a provisioning cycle for the DPUs using the new BFB image:

```shell
kubectl delete dpu -n dpf-operator-system worker1-0000-2b-00 worker2-0000-2b-00
```
**4.** You can later delete the previous BFB object:

```shell
kubectl delete bfb -n dpf-operator-system bf-bundle
```

### Using several DPU Sets

There's an option to create several DPU-Set objects, and assign them to different groups of worker nodes.
This is done by adding relevant labels to the node selector in the DPUSet object YAML.
Each DPU Set can use a different BFB object, can have a different DPU flavor, a different rolling update strategy, etc.

For example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DPUSet
metadata:
  name: dpuset-dk
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  dpuNodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      e2e.servers/dk: "true"
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: "10%"
    type: RollingUpdate
  dpuTemplate:
    spec:
      dpuFlavor: passthrough
      bfb:
      name: bf-bundle-dk-ga
      nodeEffect:
      taint:
        key: "dpu"
        value: "provisioning"
        effect: NoSchedule
```

## Cluster Configuration

The `spec.dpuTemplate.spec.cluster` section in the DPUSet allows you to specify configuration for the Kubernetes cluster
that the DPU will join.

### nodeLabels

The `spec.cluster.nodeLabels` field specifies custom labels to add to the Kubernetes node when the DPU joins the cluster.
This is a map of string key-value pairs. The system automatically adds the following labels in addition to any custom
labels you specify:
- `provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/host` - The hostname of the host machine
- `operator.dpu.nvidia.com/dpf-version` - The DPF version used

Example usage with custom labels:

```yaml
spec:
  dpuTemplate:
    spec:
      cluster:
        nodeLabels:
          environment: production
          workload-type: ai-training
          rack-id: "rack-42"
```

## DPU Selection

The DPUSet provides two complementary mechanisms for selecting which DPUs should be managed: `dpuNodeSelector` and
`dpuDeviceSelector`.

### dpuNodeSelector

The `dpuNodeSelector` field is used to select DPUNodes based on their labels. It uses the 
standard Kubernetes LabelSelector format, which supports both `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions`.

For example, to select nodes with a specific label:

```yaml
spec:
  dpuNodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      feature.node.kubernetes.io/dpu-enabled: "true"
```

Or using match expressions for more complex selection:

```yaml
spec:
  dpuNodeSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: environment
        operator: In
        values:
          - production
          - staging
```

### dpuDeviceSelector

The `dpuDeviceSelector` field is used to further filter DPUDevices based on their labels. This is applied after the
`dpuNodeSelector` and allows you to select specific DPUDevices on the selected DPUNodes.

The `dpuDeviceSelector` uses the standard Kubernetes LabelSelector format, which supports both `matchLabels` and
`matchExpressions`.

For example, to select only specific DPU models or configurations:

```yaml
spec:
  dpuNodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      feature.node.kubernetes.io/dpu-enabled: "true"
  dpuDeviceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/dpudevice-pciAddress: "0000:1a:00.0"
```

Or using match expressions for more complex selection:

```yaml
spec:
  dpuNodeSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: feature.node.kubernetes.io/dpu-enabled
      operator: Exists
  dpuDeviceSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/dpudevice-num-of-pfs
      operator: In
      values:
        - "2"
        - "4"
```

In Host Trusted model, the automatically created DPUDevice objects have the following labels:

- `provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/dpudevice-num-of-pfs`: The number of PFs on the DPU device
- `provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/dpudevice-pciAddress`: The PCI address of the DPU device
- `provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/dpudevice-pf0-name`: The name of PF0 on the DPU device
- `provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/dpunode-name`: The name of the DPUNode the DPU is part of

### Selection Flow

## Host Power-cycle in DPU provisioning

If the version of running BFB is lower than 2.7 before DPU provisioning, the BlueField firmware upgrades and mlxconfig
parameter changes require a host power-cycle. Once the version of BFB is updated to be greater than or equal to 2.7 a
regular reboot would be enough.

For enabling this, the DPUSet provides one annotations in dpuTemplate:
`provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/host-power-cycle-required` - trigger the host power-cycle (cold boot) instead of warm reboot
after DPU provisioning, notice that after the power cycle command is done the annotation would be removed from the DPU
and DPUSet objects.

Following is an example to enable host power-cycle:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DPUSet
metadata:
  name: dpuset
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  dpuNodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      feature.node.kubernetes.io/dpu-enabled: "true"
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: "10%"
    type: RollingUpdate
  dpuTemplate:
    annotations:
      provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/host-power-cycle-required: "true"
    spec:
      dpuFlavor: passthrough
      bfb:
        name: bf-bundle-new
      nodeEffect:
        taint:
          key: "dpu"
          value: "provisioning"
          effect: NoSchedule
```

## Secure Boot

The DPUSet template supports an optional `secureBoot` field that controls whether UEFI Secure Boot should be enabled
on the DPUs. When set, DPF detects the current hardware state and configures it to match the desired value during
provisioning.

```yaml
spec:
  dpuTemplate:
    spec:
      secureBoot: true
```

### Behavior by provisioning mode

**Zero Trust (Redfish):** If the current hardware state does not match `secureBoot`, the controller stages the
configuration via the BMC and performs the required ARM force restarts.

**Trusted Host (Host Agent):** The host agent can detect the current Secure Boot state but **cannot configure** it.
If there is a mismatch between the desired and actual state, the DPU transitions to **Error**.
Secure Boot must be configured manually (e.g. via the DPU's UEFI menu) before provisioning.
See [Arm OS Secure Boot (Configured from UEFI)](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/bluefieldbsp/arm+os+secure+boot+(configured+from+uefi)) for details.

### Changing Secure Boot on an existing DPUSet

The `secureBoot` field on a `DPU` object is **immutable**. Changing `secureBoot` in the
DPUSet template triggers a **disruptive update**: existing DPUs are deleted and recreated with the new value, following
the DPUSet's update strategy (e.g. `RollingUpdate`).

## IPMI Command Annotation for Kubernetes Worker Node

The provisioning controller will issue a `ipmi` command to the host to do host power-cycle(cold boot) or warm reboot
after DPU provisioning. The default host power-cycle command is `ipmitool chassis power cycle` and warm reboot command
is `ipmitool chassis power reset`

For some kinds of servers that uses `ipmitool chassis power reset` command for host cold power-cycle instead of
`ipmitool chassis power cycle`. DPF supports changing the host power-cycle/warm reboot command by setting the following
annotation on such kind of worker nodes:

```yaml
provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/powercycle-command: reset
```

## Node effect

Node effect specifies how changes to the DPU should affect the Kubernetes Node the DPU belongs to. Only the following
options can be specified:

* noEffect (bool) - no effect on the node at all
* customLabel (object) - adds the label provided to the Kubernetes Node and DPUNode, ONLY relevant to Kubernetes environment,
    when there is a match of DPUNode and Kubernetes Node
* taint (object) - marks the node as tainted, ONLY relevant to Kubernetes environment, when there is a match of DPUNode
    and Kubernetes Node
* drain (bool)(default) - drains the node and waits till the draining is finished, ONLY relevant to Kubernetes environment,
    when there is a match of DPUNode and Kubernetes Node - this is the default behaviour in a Kubernetes environment
* customAction (string) - name of a ConfigMap which contains a Pod definition - in YAML - to run which will apply the node
    effect. The Pod is expected to exit when node effect is done, if the Pod terminates with error then DPU would move
    to Error phase. First, create a ConfigMap with the pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: custom-node-effect
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
data:
  pod.yaml: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: custom-node-effect-pod
      namespace: dpf-operator-system
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: node-effect
        image: ubuntu:20.04
        command: ["/bin/bash"]
        args:
        - -c
        - |
          # Example custom node effect script
          echo "Applying custom node effect..."
          # Add your custom logic here
          # For example: network configuration, system checks, reboot.
          sleep 10  # Simulating some work
          exit 0    # Exit successfully when done
      restartPolicy: Never
```

Then, create the DPUSet that uses this custom action

```yaml
apiVersion: provisioning.dpu.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DPUSet
metadata:
  name: dpuset-custom-effect
  namespace: dpf-operator-system
spec:
  dpuNodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      feature.node.kubernetes.io/dpu-enabled: "true"
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: "10%"
    type: RollingUpdate
  dpuTemplate:
    spec:
      dpuFlavor: passthrough
      bfb:
        name: bf-bundle-new
      nodeEffect:
        customAction: custom-node-effect
```

* hold (bool) - places an annotation with key `wait-for-external-nodeeffect` on the DPU object and waits for it to be
    removed - this is the default behaviour in a non Kubernetes environment

### Additional Node Effect Configuration

The following additional fields can be configured within the `nodeEffect` section:

* **force** (bool) - when set to `true`, the node effect is applied immediately, bypassing `dpfOperatorConfig.spec.provisioningController.multiDPUOperationsSyncWaitTime` and `dpfOperatorConfig.spec.provisioningController.maxUnavailableDPUNodes` settings. Default: `false`.

* **applyOnLabelChange** (bool) - when set to `true`, changes to `spec.cluster.nodeLabels` on DPUs in Ready state will trigger the node effect logic. This is useful when you want the configured node effect (drain, taint, etc.) to be applied when DPU cluster node labels are updated. Default: `false`.

Example configuration:

```yaml
spec:
  dpuTemplate:
    spec:
      cluster:
        nodeLabels:
          environment: staging
          tier: standard
      nodeEffect:
        drain: true
        applyOnLabelChange: true
```

With this configuration, updating the `spec.cluster.nodeLabels` on a Ready DPU (e.g., adding a new label `tier: production` or changing `environment: staging` to `environment: production`) will trigger the drain node effect.

* **nodeMaintenanceAdditionalRequestors** (array of strings) - additional requestors to be added to the NVIDIA NodeMaintenance CR when Drain is selected. This field is automatically managed by the DPUDeployment controller for coordinating upgrades of DPUServices and DPUServiceChains. Advanced users can also set this manually in standalone DPUSets to coordinate maintenance with external systems.

Example for advanced manual coordination:

```yaml
spec:
  dpuTemplate:
    spec:
      nodeEffect:
        drain: true
        nodeMaintenanceAdditionalRequestors:
          - "custom-coordination-service"
          - "external-maintenance-system"
```
