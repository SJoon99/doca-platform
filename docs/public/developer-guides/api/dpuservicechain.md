This document describes how to use DPUServiceChain in DPF.

# Introduction

The purpose of DPUServiceChain is to allow user to define how to steer traffic on DPU through DPUServiceInterfaces.
The following controllers are used internally to achieve this.

1. User creates DPUServiceChain, servicechaincontroller consumes it on the host cluster.

2. ServiceChainSet is created on DPU clusters

3. ServiceChain is created for individual nodes based on nodeSelector.

4. SFC controller provisions the necessary network configurations on DPU.

# How to Use DPUServiceChain
DPUServiceChain example:

The following YAML manifest defines a DPUServiceChain named `example-chain` and refers to one DPUService named `example-service`
and 4 DPUServiceInterfaces. DPUServiceChain will define how the traffic will flow through those DPUServiceInterfaces.

`DPUServiceInterfaces`

                    matchLabels:
                      uplink: p0
                - serviceInterface:
                    matchLabels:
                      svc.dpu.nvidia.com/service: example-service
                      svc.dpu.nvidia.com/interface: eth1
            - ports:
                - serviceInterface:
                    matchLabels:
                      svc.dpu.nvidia.com/service: example-service
                      svc.dpu.nvidia.com/interface: eth2
                - serviceInterface:
                    matchLabels:
                      uplink: pf0hpf
              serviceMTU: 2000
```

Let's break it down step by step.

1. There are 4 DPUServiceInterfaces
    1. uplink port p0
    2. uplink port pf0hpf on host
    3. service interface eth1
    4. service interface eth2

2. There is one DPUService
    1. example-service which has two interfaces eth1 and eth2

3. There is one DPUServiceChain
    1. example-chain
        `p0 --> eth1 --> eth2 --> pf0hpf`

4. On the switches object there is `serviceMTU` which defines the MTU between services in the DPU cluster
    1. The default value for this MTU is 1500
    2. **NOTE**: This only affects services on the DPU, it should be aligned with the general MTU set for the traffic in
        the network
    3. **NOTE**: That when changed, it will restart every pod that relates to this switch
    4. **NOTE**: The maximum value of `serviceMTU` can't exceed the `highspeedMTU` value from the `dpfOperatorConfig`

In the above example, traffic will flow from uplink port p0 to example DPU service's eth1 iface. From eth1 iface, it
will go to eth2 iface(eth1->eth2 is handled by the service itself and not by the chain) and then to uplink port pf0hpf
on the host.

# Constraints
## DPUServiceInterface and ServiceInterface uniqueness
Each physical uplink port (e.g., `p0`) must be owned by exactly one
`DPUServiceInterface`, and each `matchLabels` selector used in a
`DPUServiceChain` must resolve to exactly one `ServiceInterface` per node.
These constraints are **not enforced at admission time** — there are no
validating webhooks that reject conflicting objects. Instead, violations are
detected at runtime by the SFC controller and surface as persistent errors on
the `ServiceChain` (and therefore the `ServiceChainSet`).
### Why this matters
A physical OVS port can only be associated with a single `ServiceInterface`
via its `dpf-id` external ID. If two `DPUServiceInterface` objects target the
same physical port, only one will own the OVS port at any given time. The
other's `ServiceChain` will fail to find its OVS interface, causing errors and
flapping readiness.
The SFC controller also requires that the `matchLabels` selector in each
`DPUServiceChain` port resolves to exactly one `ServiceInterface` on each
node. If the selector matches zero or more than one, reconciliation fails.
### Error messages
When the `matchLabels` selector matches **no** `ServiceInterface` on a node:
```
no serviceInterface in namespace(<ns>) matching labels(map[<key>:<value>]) on node(<node>) found
```
When the selector matches **more than one** `ServiceInterface` on a node:
```
expected only one serviceInterface in namespace(<ns>) to match labels(map[<key>:<value>]) on node(<node>). found <N>
```
When the Kubernetes lookup succeeds but the OVS port belongs to a different
`ServiceInterface`:
```
failed to find matching interface with external_ids: map[dpf-id:<namespace>/<serviceinterface-name>]
```
In all cases, the `ServiceChain` (and therefore the `ServiceChainSet`) will
remain `Ready=False` or flip between `Ready` and `Pending`.
### Common causes
* **Conflict with another service** — if a DOCA service such as HBN already
  installs a `DPUServiceInterface` for a physical port (e.g., `p0` with label
  `uplink: p0`), creating another `DPUServiceInterface` for the same physical
  port will cause a conflict. Even if the labels differ, both produce
  `ServiceInterface` objects on each node, but the OVS port can only carry one
  `dpf-id`. The chain referencing the non-owning `ServiceInterface` will fail
  with `failed to find matching interface`. If the labels are identical, the
  `matchLabels` selector will match multiple `ServiceInterface` objects and
  fail with `expected only one serviceInterface`.
* **Stale objects** — leftover `ServiceInterface` objects from a previous
  `DPUServiceInterface` deployment can satisfy the same selector, producing
  multiple matches on a node. Delete stale objects before re-deploying.
### How to avoid these issues
* Ensure each physical port is targeted by at most one `DPUServiceInterface`.
* Verify that your `matchLabels` selector resolves to exactly one
  `ServiceInterface` on each target node.
* Check for stale `ServiceInterface` objects from previous deployments before
  applying a new `DPUServiceChain`.

# Additional fields

## DPUClusterSelector

The `spec.dpuClusterSelector` field is used to select which DPU clusters the
chain configuration is applied to. It uses standard Kubernetes label selector
syntax (`matchLabels` and `matchExpressions`) to match against `DPUCluster`
labels. If not specified, the configuration is applied to all DPU clusters.

Both `DPUServiceChain` and `DPUServiceInterface` support `dpuClusterSelector`,
allowing control over which clusters receive specific interface configurations.

Example:

```yaml
spec:
  dpuClusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      environment: production
```
